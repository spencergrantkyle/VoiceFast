- Company name
- 2-3 specific problems
- Budget, deadline, team size
- Tech stack

**Example**: See above (Sarah from TechStart)

### Minimal Message
Send:
> "Need help with slow database queries"

**You'll see:**
- Transcription
- "Problems Identified: 1"
  - Slow database queries
- Research progress
- Solutions found
- Report

### Text Message (Also Works!)
Type:
> "I'm having issues with API performance"

**Same updates as voice!**

## 🔍 What to Watch For

### ✅ Good Signs
- Updates arrive every 5-15 seconds
- Problems list matches what you said
- No error messages
- Final report is comprehensive

### ⚠️ If Something's Wrong
- **No updates**: Check bot is running (`npm run bot`)
- **Transcription error**: Voice might be unclear
- **No problems found**: Try mentioning issues more explicitly
- **Missing updates**: Check internet connection

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Get Better Problem Extraction
1. **Say "problem" or "issue"**: "Our first problem is..."
2. **Be specific**: "Database is slow" → "Database queries take 5+ seconds"
3. **Mention impact**: "...which is causing us to lose customers"
4. **Use numbers**: "200 tickets daily", "$15k budget"

### See More Updates
The bot shows up to 5 problems in the update message. If you mention 6+, it will show:
```
✅ Problems Identified: 8

1. Problem one
2. Problem two
3. Problem three
4. Problem four
5. Problem five
... and 3 more
```

(All problems are still in the final report!)
