### Technical Details

The bot uses the `runWorkflowWithUpdates()` function which:

1. Runs the original `runWorkflow()` from `agent.ts`
2. Extracts intermediate results
3. Sends Telegram messages at key milestones
4. Returns final formatted results

**Files involved:**
- `telegram-bot.ts` - Lines 35-121: `runWorkflowWithUpdates()`
- `agent.ts` - Original workflow logic
- `telegram.ts` - Message sending utilities

## 📊 Customization

Want to change what's shown? Edit `telegram-bot.ts`:

### Add More Updates

```typescript
// After Step 1
await sendTelegramMessage(
  botToken,
  chatId,
  `🎯 Also extracted:\n• Budget: ${result.full_report.constraints?.budget}\n• Deadline: ${result.full_report.constraints?.deadline}`
);
```

### Change Emoji/Formatting

```typescript
// Change the step indicators
"🔍 Step 1/3"  →  "📊 Phase 1"
"✅ Problems"  →  "🚨 Issues Found"
```

### Show Research Items Details

```typescript
if (result.full_report?.research_items) {
  const topItems = result.full_report.research_items.slice(0, 3);
  const itemsList = topItems.map((item: any, i: number) => 
    `${i + 1}. ${item.title} (Impact: ${item.impact}/10)`
  ).join('\n');
  
  await sendTelegramMessage(
    botToken,
    chatId,
    `🔍 Top Solutions:\n\n${itemsList}`
  );
}
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Update Frequency

Current: Updates sent at major milestones (5-6 messages total)

To add more granular updates, modify `runWorkflowWithUpdates()` in `telegram-bot.ts`.

### Message Throttling

Telegram rate limits:
- Max 30 messages/second per bot
- Max 1 message/second per chat

Current implementation is well within limits (1 message every 5-10 seconds).
