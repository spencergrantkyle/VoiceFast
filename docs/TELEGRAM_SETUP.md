# 📱 Telegram Integration Setup

Your VoiceFast agent can now send results directly to Telegram! Here's how to set it up.

## ✅ Already Done

- ✅ `TELEGRAM_API_KEY` added to `.env`
- ✅ Telegram integration code added
- ✅ Helper script created to get Chat ID

## 🚀 Quick Setup (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Get Your Telegram Chat ID

You need to find your Telegram Chat ID so the bot knows where to send messages.

```bash
npm run get-chat-id
```

**If you see "No messages found":**
1. Open Telegram on your phone/desktop
2. Search for your bot (the one you created with @BotFather)
3. Send any message to it (like "hello")
4. Run `npm run get-chat-id` again

**The script will show:**
```
📱 Chat ID: 123456789
   Type: private
   Name: Your Name
   Username: @yourusername

   Add this to your .env file:
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=123456789
```

### Step 2: Add Chat ID to .env

Copy the Chat ID and update your `.env` file:

```env
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=123456789
```

That's it! 🎉

## 🎯 Test It

```bash
npm run run

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "TELEGRAM_API_KEY not found"
- Make sure you added it to `.env` file
- Check for typos in the variable name

### "TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID not found"
- Run `npm run get-chat-id` to get your Chat ID
- Add it to `.env`: `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your-chat-id`

### "Failed to send Telegram message"
- Check your bot token is valid
- Make sure you've sent at least one message to the bot
- Verify the Chat ID is correct

### Bot not responding
- Make sure you started a conversation with your bot
- Send any message to activate it
- Bot username should end with "bot"

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Message Format

Edit `telegram.ts` → `formatAgentResultsForTelegram()` function to customize the message layout.

### Send to Multiple Chats

You can modify the code to send to multiple chat IDs:

```typescript
const CHAT_IDS = [
  process.env.TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID_1,
  process.env.TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID_2,
];

for (const chatId of CHAT_IDS) {
  await sendTelegramMessage(botToken, chatId, message);
}
```

### Disable Telegram Notifications

Simply remove or comment out `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` from `.env` and the agent will skip Telegram sending (but still save files locally).

## 📚 How It Works

1. **Agent completes** → Extracts all information
2. **Results formatted** → Converts to Telegram markdown
3. **Message sent** → Via Telegram Bot API
4. **You get notified** → Instant notification on your phone/desktop

The agent will still save JSON and Markdown files locally, so you have a complete record even if Telegram is down.

## 🔐 Security Notes

- ✅ Bot token is stored in `.env` (not committed to git)
- ✅ Only sends to your specific Chat ID
- ✅ Messages are encrypted by Telegram
- ✅ No data stored on Telegram servers (only messages)

## 🌟 Pro Tips

1. **Pin important messages** in Telegram to easily find agent reports later
2. **Create a dedicated channel** for agent reports if you run many agents
3. **Use Telegram search** to quickly find reports by contact name or company
4. **Set up groups** to share reports with your team automatically
